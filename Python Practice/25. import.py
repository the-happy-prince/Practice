import math
# import math as m ---> to write 'm' instead of 'math'. This will avoid writing big package name

from math import *
# This will work but not recommended

from math import sqrt
# Similarly, from math import sqrt as s

from math import pi, sqrt as s
# It will import pi as it is but sqrt as s

# Note: We can also create a .py file and declare function and print statements and we can import them in other files
